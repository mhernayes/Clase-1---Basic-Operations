Introduction
In Python, a variable is a name that is used to refer to a value. The value of a variable can be changed, and it can be of different types, such as integers, floating-point numbers, strings, and booleans.

This repository provides examples of basic operations on variables and data types in Python. The examples include basic arithmetic operations, comparison operations, logical operations, and type conversion operations.

Data Types
Python has several built-in data types, including:

Integers: Integers are whole numbers, such as -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3.
Floating-point numbers: Floating-point numbers are numbers with a decimal point, such as 3.14, -0.1, 2.0.
Strings: Strings are sequences of characters, such as "Hello, World!" or 'Python'.
Booleans: Booleans are either True or False.
Operations on Variables and Data Types
The repository contains code examples for the following operations:

Arithmetic Operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo, and exponentiation.
Comparison Operations: Comparison of two values to check if they are equal, not equal, greater than, less than, greater than or equal to, or less than or equal to.
Logical Operations: And, Or, and Not operations on two boolean values.
Type Conversion Operations: Conversion of one data type to another data type, such as conversion of an integer to a string or a string to an integer.
